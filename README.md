# Password Manager
Educational project for the Object-Oriented Programming exam developed in C++ and Qt framework.

_"Password Manager is a software for managing sensitive information that offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.  
Users can create, modify, delete, and view different types of data, including logins for websites and applications, credit/debit cards, and notes containing sensitive information such as private SSH keys or cryptocurrency wallet access codes. All information is ultimately saved in an encrypted file that prevents access to it outside of the software and ensures its confidentiality."_
